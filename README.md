# Bank Loan Management

Hello, welcome to my first terminal app written in Cobol.

This is a self-study project licensed under the MIT license. Feel free to submit your PR and help me build more robust Cobol code!

## How did this start?

It all started when I saw a job posting asking for Cobol software development skills. Almost all of the code I developed was an attempt to get closer to what they were asking for and see if I could get a job! (PLEASE GIVE ME A JOB!!)

##### Are you serious?

Yes. I like learning all kinds of tools, languages, and concepts! I admit that Cobol was very complicated to understand. But I did my best.

## What is the purpose?

Create a terminal user flow that allows you to create an account, manage credit cards, transactions, and more.

And of course, it's built in Cobol.

For this project, I'm using GNUCobol and some self-learning resources I found online.

> Without taking AI out of the picture, as a novice, AI helped me solve strange problems. Thanks, AI, for saving me hours and hours of searching for an error on the 1:0 line.

(Imagine one day managing your bank account through a terminal in Arch Linux... I don't know, dude, sounds like fun.)
